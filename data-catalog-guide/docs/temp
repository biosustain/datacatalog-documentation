    *   **Creating a Project:**
        *   Guide users through the process of setting up a new project in the Data Catalog, including how to:
            *   Provide basic project information (e.g., title, description, funding).
            *   Add collaborators and manage project roles (e.g., PI, co-PI). 
            *   Answer administrative questions (e.g., patent potential, compliance issues).
            *   Complete and attach a data management plan (DMP).
            *   Link to relevant external resources (e.g., DTUDOCX project, Benchling project folder).
        *   **Searching and Browsing Projects:**
            *   Explain how to find existing projects:
                *   Using keywords and filters.
                *   By research group or department.
                *   By data type or method used.
            *   Detail how to view project information:
                *   Metadata.
                *   Datasets.
                *   Associated publications.
    *   **Working with Data:**
        *   **Adding Data to a Project:**
            *   Guide users on how to upload and register data in the Data Catalog, including different options for:
                *   Data types.
                *   Data formats.
                *   File sizes.
                *   Storage locations (e.g., local storage, external repositories).
        *   **Metadata:**
            *   Explain the importance of providing comprehensive metadata for each dataset:
                *   Using the Data Dictionary as a guide. 
                *   Following FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
        *   **Data Access and Sharing:** 
            *   Provide instructions on:
                *   Setting data access levels (e.g., private, group, public).

                *   Understanding the implications of GDPR and other compliance requirements. 
## Advanced Features:
    *   **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) Integration:**
        *   Explain how the Data Catalog integrates with Benchling: 
            *   Linking Benchling project folders to projects in the Data Catalog. 
            *   Importing metadata from Benchling. 
    *   **Reporting:**
        *   Detail the types of reports available:
            *   Project progress reports. 
            *   Data usage reports.
            *   Compliance reports. 
        *   Explain how to generate and customize reports.
    *   **System Integration:** 
        *   Describe future integrations with other systems, such as DTU Orbit, DTU Data, and HPC.  
        *   This information is described as future possibilities, so you may wish to independently verify the current status of these integrations.
