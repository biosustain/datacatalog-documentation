# Biosustain Data Catalog Overview

## Purpose of the Data Catalog

The Biosustain Data Catalog aims to store and manage active data, making it as open as possible and as close as necessary. 

The RDM Team at DTU Biosusain has the following goals (prioritized order):
1.	Enable capture of all data types (in-house and externally generated) as automated and structured as possible.
2.	Enable metadata capture, data enrichment and efficient automated workflows.
3.	Provide visibility, access and overview of accessible data.
4.	Enable standard data processing/analysis when requested.
With all the above supported by the two following principles: 
1.	Ensure governance on all systems and data.
2.	Establish a strong support structure.
